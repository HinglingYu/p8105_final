## The tentative project title:

**Swipe or Click: Unraveling the Spending Tug-of-War**

## The motivation for this project:

- In an era where digital storefronts are as common as physical aisles,
  consumer spending habits have evolved. While online shopping presents
  a convenience, allowing modern shoppers to indulge from the comfort of
  their homes, there’s an ongoing debate: does this ease translate to
  more dollars spent? Despite the convenience of digital transactions, a
  surprising trend persists—shoppers often spend more during physical
  store visits.

## The intended final products:

- A website features the project and a screencast that describes our
  project.
- A page of graphs and charts illustrating the spending patterns,
  differences in in-store vs online shopping, and other relevant trends,
  a page for analysis of some factors and approaches we used, a page for
  report and link to github.
- A detailed analysis report summarizing our findings, methodologies,
  and implications for both consumers and retailers.

## The anticipated data sources:

- We will utilize a dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes customer
  personalities, purchasing behaviors, and specific needs of different
  customer types. It comprises 2240 observations, providing a robust
  foundation for our analysis.

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenge:

#### Analyses:

- Hypothesis test (two sample mean test): perform statistical tests to
  compare average spending amounts between online and in-store
  purchasers.
- Sensitivity analysis: use sensitivity analysis to test the validity of
  the project
- Result interpretation: Interpreting the results of our analyses in the
  context of customer behavior and spending.

#### Visualizations:

- Develop histogram, bar plots and scatter plots to visually represent
  data trends and model results.

#### Challenges :

- Model fitting: there are some confounding variables that could affect
  the result of this research such as customers’ income, education
  level, marital status, and age. So we need to make causal inference on
  observational dataset by using applicable methods.
