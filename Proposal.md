## The tentative project title:

Swipe or Click: Unraveling the Spending Tug-of-War

## The motivation for this project:

In an era where digital storefronts are as common as physical aisles,
consumer spending habits have evolved. While online shopping presents a
convenience, allowing modern shoppers to indulge from the comfort of
their homes, there’s an ongoing debate: does this ease translate to more
dollars spent? Despite the convenience of digital transactions, a
surprising trend persists—shoppers often spend more during physical
store visits.
